    "# Pre-Assignment Information About Matrix Manipulations\n",
    "\n",
    "In Module 1 of this course, there is a primer on Python which include a section on matrices. You may recall that matrix multiplication in Python is achieved by using the <code>np.matmul()</code> function. In this course, we will often be dealing with powers of a matrix. If you want to take, for example, the 2nd power of the matrix $P$, you could type `np.matmul(P,P)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "For higher powers of the matrix $P$:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li> One possibility for higher powers of the matrix $P$ is to use nested calls to the np.matmul() function. For example, suppose that we wish to return the $(0,1)$ entry of $P^{3}$. We need to multiply $P$ by $P$ and then multiply by $P$ again! We could type <code>np.matmul(np.matmul(P,P),P)[0,1]</code>.</li><br>\n",
    "    <li>A second option is to use the \"@\" operator. This is actually np.matmul() in disguise and is much more readable. Note that if we type <code>P@P@P[0,1]</code> in order to pull out the $(0,1)$ entry of $P^{3}$, we will get an error. Here, Python  thinks that we are trying to multiply the matrix $P$ by the matrix $P$ by the scalar $P[0,1]$. While we can multiply a matrix by a scalar, this will not work with the \"@\" operator. We can avoid this error by using parentheses and typing <code>(P@P@P)[0,1]</code>.  </li><br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "   <li> In this lab, we may need much higher powers of matrices. Suppose that we want to find $P^{9}$. While it is cumbersome to type out matrix multiplication such as <code>P@P@P@P@P@P@P@P@P</code>, you may certainly do it. There are no \"style points\" given at the completion of this notebook assignment!<br>\n",
    "       The alternative, however, is to use the scary looking command <code>np.linalg.matrix_power(P, 9)</code>. To get the $(0,1)$ entry of $P^{9}$, we can type <code>np.linalg.matrix_power(P, 9)[0,1]</code>. </li>   \n",

    "Consider moving from state $1$ to state $0$ in one step. The only way to move down to $0$ flies is for the frog to land on (and therefore eat) the one fly and for no new flies to join the system. The frog will land on the one fly with probability $1/3$ since there are $3$ possible lily pads to hop to and only $1$ with a fly on it. No new fly joins the system with probability $2/3$. Thus, by independence of frog hops and whether or not a new fly joins, we have $P(X_{n+1}=0|X_{n}=1)= (1/3)(2/3) = (2/9)$."
